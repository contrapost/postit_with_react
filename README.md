### PostIt App with React

Simple React app based on [lynda.com course](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/Learn-React-js-Basics/519668-2.html). App populates notes with random jokes from [The Internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com/).

App is basically a view without any database solution.
